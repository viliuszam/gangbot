# gangbot

Explore the code at your own peril (riddled with arbitrary thread delays, magic numbers everywhere, gross static typing), I am uploading this out of pure nostalgia of messing with terrible games after finding the code on my old drive.

The bot uses selenium webdriver, has the functionality to handle the crappy captcha thrown at us by the game, accomplishes basic tasks (farming, harvesting, skilling etc.)

Dependencies for anybody willing to compile this atrocity (no gradle or maven, sorry):
* Tess4J
* OpenQA Selenium Webdriver


Don't expect this to be updated and/or touched ever again, lol
